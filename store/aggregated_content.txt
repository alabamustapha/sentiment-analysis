About Carnegie Mellon University Africa

Carnegie Mellon University Africa

Kigali, Rwanda

CMU-Africa’s vision is to educate and empower the next generation of African leaders and innovators by delivering a world-class educational experience. Our mission is to produce creative and technically strong engineers, who have been trained in the African context and prepared to make a transformative impact in their communities and the world.

In 2011, upon the invitation of the Government of Rwanda (GoR), Carnegie Mellon and the GoR signed an agreement to establish a new CMU location in Kigali, Rwanda. This ambitious and innovative partnership was designed to respond to the critical shortage of high-quality engineering talent required to harness Africa’s tremendous potential as home to the fastest-growing workforce in the world.

CMU-Africa, located in Kigali Innovation City, is a regional ICT center of excellence educating a diverse composition of future leaders from all over Africa, who will use their hands-on skills and knowledge to advance technology innovation and grow businesses.

Carnegie Mellon University’s presence in Rwanda continues to provide a platform to engage in Africa’s most significant opportunities and challenges through world-class education and contextually relevant research.

300+ students

26% women

22 nationalities

550+ alumni

Carnegie Mellon University Africa is looking for exceptional faculty candidates who are excited to become a part of our dynamic and innovative programs in Kigali. Check out our open opportunities.

Carnegie Mellon University is committed to supporting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through the Sustainability Initiative at CMU. The SDGs, also known as the Global Goals, are 17 global objectives to create a more equitable and viable planet by 2030. These goals came together following input from millions of people around the world, with younger generations especially engaged. They were adopted by the global community at the United Nations in 2015.

At CMU-Africa, the SDGs set out clear objectives for researchers working in the African context. They are focused on positive societal outcomes that apply to Africa and the global community. The SDGs set a mindset for researchers to think beyond specific technical questions and consider the potential of their work in society.

With the common language of the SDGs, researchers can speak with each other and identify collaborators across geographic and disciplinary divides. In these ways, the SDG framework is the key to unlocking the potential of the diverse research of CMU-Africa faculty.

Learn more about what the SDGs mean to the CMU-Africa community.

KCRC and CMU-Africa have a shared mission to enable collaborative research and innovations in Africa. The center, located in Kigali Innovation City, aims to be a leading research organization in Africa dedicated to establishing and facilitating high standards and diverse research and innovations.

About Carnegie Mellon University Africa

Carnegie Mellon University Africa

Kigali, Rwanda

CMU-Africa’s vision is to educate and empower the next generation of African leaders and innovators by delivering a world-class educational experience. Our mission is to produce creative and technically strong engineers, who have been trained in the African context and prepared to make a transformative impact in their communities and the world.

In 2011, upon the invitation of the Government of Rwanda (GoR), Carnegie Mellon and the GoR signed an agreement to establish a new CMU location in Kigali, Rwanda. This ambitious and innovative partnership was designed to respond to the critical shortage of high-quality engineering talent required to harness Africa’s tremendous potential as home to the fastest-growing workforce in the world.

CMU-Africa, located in Kigali Innovation City, is a regional ICT center of excellence educating a diverse composition of future leaders from all over Africa, who will use their hands-on skills and knowledge to advance technology innovation and grow businesses.

Carnegie Mellon University’s presence in Rwanda continues to provide a platform to engage in Africa’s most significant opportunities and challenges through world-class education and contextually relevant research.

300+ students

26% women

22 nationalities

550+ alumni

Carnegie Mellon University Africa is looking for exceptional faculty candidates who are excited to become a part of our dynamic and innovative programs in Kigali. Check out our open opportunities.

Carnegie Mellon University is committed to supporting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through the Sustainability Initiative at CMU. The SDGs, also known as the Global Goals, are 17 global objectives to create a more equitable and viable planet by 2030. These goals came together following input from millions of people around the world, with younger generations especially engaged. They were adopted by the global community at the United Nations in 2015.

At CMU-Africa, the SDGs set out clear objectives for researchers working in the African context. They are focused on positive societal outcomes that apply to Africa and the global community. The SDGs set a mindset for researchers to think beyond specific technical questions and consider the potential of their work in society.

With the common language of the SDGs, researchers can speak with each other and identify collaborators across geographic and disciplinary divides. In these ways, the SDG framework is the key to unlocking the potential of the diverse research of CMU-Africa faculty.

Learn more about what the SDGs mean to the CMU-Africa community.

KCRC and CMU-Africa have a shared mission to enable collaborative research and innovations in Africa. The center, located in Kigali Innovation City, aims to be a leading research organization in Africa dedicated to establishing and facilitating high standards and diverse research and innovations.
